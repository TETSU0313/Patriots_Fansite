            <h3>Sony Michel Interview</h3>
            <p>Patriots rookie Sony Michel isn’t the first running back out of Georgia to stir up excitement.
              <br>
              Todd Gurley and Nick Chubb are two fellow former Bulldogs in the position,
              with Gurley in his fourth season with the Los Angeles Rams and Chubb another highly
              touted pick in this year’s draft. When asked about his thoughts on the great tradition of
              running backs coming out of his alma mater, the Georgia alum was quick to give credit to his
              mentors in Foxborough instead.

              “I wouldn’t say I’m a great. … Georgia has some great backs. Patriots have some great backs too,”
              Michel said to reporters on Sunday. “I actually have a chance to learn from one of them,
              James White, and many more – Brandon (Bolden), Rex (Burkhead), a lot of those guys in that
              room I get to learn from, and I think that’s very cool also.”
              <br>
              Gurley logged 13 touchdowns last season with the Rams, while Chubb will start his rookie season
              with the Cleveland Browns. Michel was the 31st overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft, while Chubb
              came in four spots later at 35th.

            <h3>Brady on McDaniels Interview</h3>
            <p>One of the familiar faces at Patriots training camp this weekend was Josh McDaniels,
              who shocked the league earlier this year when he returned to New England after accepting
              the head coaching position with the Indianapolis Colts.
              <br>
              While the Boston Herald reported Tom Brady had a hand in McDaniels’ return, Brady dodged
              questions on his involvement in McDaniels’ decision.
              <br>
              RELATED
              Tom Brady won't apologize for prioritizing family in the offseason
              “I always talk to him about everything and like I said, he’s a great friend of mine …
              you work with someone for that long, you have a great rapport and relationship and I’m
              happy he’s on our team. I’m happy he’s coaching me, and I want to go out there and do well by him.”
              <br>
              So he didn’t play any role in getting McDaniels to stick around?
              <br>
              “Josh and I have had a great relationship for 18 years and he’s one of my best friends,”
              Brady said. “I love working with him and we’ve had a very special relationship that I cherish
              and it’s kind of been that way for a long time.”
              <br>
              McDaniels is going into his tenth season in New England. He worked with the Patriots
              from 2006 to 2008, spent three seasons coaching in Denver and St. Louis, and has been
              back with the Patriots since 2012.
